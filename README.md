# Package `playground/config`

This library loads config data out of JSON files via Go's standard `json` package, populating configuration objects and command line. Essentially it's a simple ORM for JSON config.

Special thanks to Playground Global, LLC for open-sourcing this software. See `LICENSE` for details.
